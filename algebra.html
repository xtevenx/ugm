See this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)#Notes_on_the_definition>Wikipedia article</a> for more information. As a subjective opinion, this seems to be somewhat of a stylistic choice: if there is no multiplicative identity, then we cannot take the product of an arbitrary collection of elements, because this would be undefined if the collection is empty. On the other hand, sometimes it simply does not make sense to force the existence of a multiplicative identity. This may not be the best example, but later we will define a special type of “subring” called an ideal, which should not be defined as requiring a multiplicative identity.</div><div id="def:commutative ring"class=definition><p><strong>Definition 3</strong> (Commutative ring).<p>A <strong>commutative ring</strong> is a <a href=#def:ring>ring</a> <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with the additional property that the multiplication operation is commutative, meaning <span class="math inline">\(ab=ba\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in R\)</span>.</div><div id="prop:unique additive identity"class=proposition><p><strong>Proposition 1</strong>. <em>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a <a href=#def:ring>ring</a>, then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has exactly one additive identity.</em></div><div class=proof><p><em>Proof.</em> By definition, we know that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has at least one additive identity, so we will show it has at most one.
