\subsection{Disclaimer}

This website is currently written and maintained by one undergraduate student (me).
I feel like everything here is---at least at its core---correct, but obviously I have a very narrow perspective on
mathematics as a whole.
As such, please do not blindly believe the material presented here, and also create a
\href{https://github.com/xtevenx/ugm/issues}{GitHub issue} if you find any errors!

\subsection{Contributing}

Please do; even just reading and keeping an eye out for errors is a contribution!

Because I am doing this mainly for selfish reasons (see "About" section below), there are currently no guidelines on
how to contribute, but feel free to create a GitHub issue to discuss.

\subsection{About}

This website was created for two main reasons.

The first is for my own desires to review past course material.
I feel that a semester (in my case, four months) is not enough time to get new information to stick in the long run, so
material is added here usually about six months to a year \textit{after} the course was taught.
This way, I can review while often gaining new insight into the material after spending a couple semesters studying
different areas of mathematics.

The second is to maybe help out other students who are in a scenario I have often been in: trying to find simple proofs
of theorems, but only getting ones which reference unknown material, or ones which just present a very rough sketch.
Do note that asking the professor is usually the best way to get a clear explanation, but sometimes that is not always
possible.

Due to these reasons, an attempt is made to present the proofs on this website in the most elementary manner possible,
or at least only referencing material which has also been covered here.
Because of this, a strong student may find the proofs too verbose, but that is by design: I am not a strong student, so
hopefully this website can help people like me.
